## Introduction

Welcome to Part 1 of my **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) Walkthrough Series**, where I demonstrate how to manage **users**, **user groups**, and **permissions** in AWS. This series is designed to keep everything short and concise, making it easier for beginners and professionals alike to follow along.

In this first video, I focus on the basics: creating user groups and adding users in AWS IAM, while also covering essential best practices for access control. Youâ€™ll learn how to structure permissions efficiently, ensuring that users have the correct level of access based on their role.

In Part 2, we'll dive deeper into permissions management, roles, and how to leverage advanced features of AWS IAM to enhance security and operational efficiency in the AWS ecosystem.

## Summary of the Video

In this video, I demonstrate how to:
- **Create user groups** for organizing users based on their roles and responsibilities.
- **Assign permissions** to user groups, including full access to services like **S3**, **DynamoDB**, and **Lambda**.
- **Create and add users** to specific user groups, such as 'Jane Doe' and 'John Doe'.
- **Provide AWS Management Console access** to users, complete with temporary passwords and security settings like password resets on first login.

I also mention some basic **IAM security best practices** regarding not using the root account for daily tasks. However, for the purpose of the tutorial, I worked from the root account to simplify the demonstration.

## Tools/Programs Used:
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Used to create user groups, users, and manage access permissions.
- **AWS S3**: Assigned full access to S3 resources for specific user groups.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: Granted DynamoDB full access to user groups, ensuring the right users have database access.
- **AWS Lambda**: Assigned permissions to user groups for managing Lambda functions.
- **AWS Management Console**: Used to create users and user groups, as well as providing console access with autogenerated passwords for users.
- **IAM Policies**: Managed permission policies and access control settings for users and groups.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- **User Group Creation**: I demonstrated creating multiple user groups such as **Admins**, **Developers**, and **Testers**, which helps manage users based on roles and access needs.
- **Permission Assignment**: I walked through assigning permissions like **S3 Full Access**, **DynamoDB Full Access**, and **Lambda Full Access** to different user groups.
- **User Creation and Access Management**: Created IAM users like **Jane Doe** and **John Doe**, and demonstrated how to assign them to specific user groups with the necessary permissions.
- **AWS Management Console Access**: Explained the process of providing AWS Management Console access to users with autogenerated temporary passwords, and the importance of requiring password changes on first login for better security.
- **Basic IAM Security Practices**: Highlighted the importance of avoiding daily tasks under the root account for better security, though the demo worked from the root for simplicity.

**In [Part 2](https://github.com/KLavallais/AWSIAM2), we explore IAM roles, more granular permissions, and continue creating users while managing their access. This next part provides deeper insights into IAM roles and demonstrates how to better secure your AWS environment using role-based access control.**

Thank you for following Part 1 of my AWS IAM tutorial series. I hope this walkthrough has helped you better understand how to create and manage users and user groups in AWS. Be sure to check out [Part 2](https://github.com/KLavallais/AWSIAM2) for a deeper dive into permissions and roles, taking your IAM skills to the next level with advanced management techniques.
